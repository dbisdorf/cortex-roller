	<h1>Cortexatron - Cortex RPG Dice Roller</h1>
	<p>Version 0.3 - by Don Bisdorf (on Mastodon as @dbisdorf@dice.camp, on Twitter as @dbisdorf)</p>
	<h2>Getting the band together</h2>
	<p>The dice roller will automatically create a new room for you. The address bar of your browser will show the location of this room. To invite your players to join your room, send them that address. If you leave a room and want to come back to it later, you can browse back to the same address, but please note that the system will delete rooms that have been inactive for a couple of weeks.</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>Add dice to your pool using the "Add Dice" buttons. Roll them with the "Roll All Dice" button in the "For All Dice" section.</p>
	<p>Select dice by clicking their checkboxes. Then, using the buttons in the "For Checked Dice" group, you can mark your dice as total or effect dice, remove them, or step them up or down. Remember that according to Cortex rules, you can't use 1s as total or effect dice.</p>
	<p>In the "Quick Choices" section, the "Choose Best Total" and "Choose Best Effect" buttons will automatically pick the best total or effect dice from the dice that haven't already been marked. The "Clear Total &amp; Effect" button will unmark all dice.</p>
	<p>Once you've marked your total and effect dice, a summary of your results will appear under the dice. You can click the "Keep Results" button to copy your result to the "Past Rolls" area. You can also click the "Remove All Dice" button to throw away all the dice and start over.</p>
	<p>Add sticky notes by typing something into the box at the bottom of the "Sticky Notes" area and clicking "Post Note". Clicking the "Remove" button next to a note will delete the note and copy its text back into the typing area, so you can edit and re-post if you wish.</p>
	<p>The checkboxes in the "Options" area allow you to control how the dice appear ono the page. These options only control your view of the dice, not the views your friends are seeing. Try the "Show dice as text" option if you're using a screen reader.</p>
	<h2>Source code</h2>
	<p>For the brave and curious, the source code is in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/dbisdorf/cortex-roller">here.</a></p>
	<p>Please note that the code is likely terrible. I'm probably using the wrong frameworks, the wrong tools, the wrong coding conventions, and so on. But it works.</p>
	<p>I'm not accepting pull requests just yet. This is a personal hobby project, and I'd rather not have to deal with managing a multi-coder work flow just yet. Once the system is more mature, I may be ready to let other swimmers in the pool.</p>
