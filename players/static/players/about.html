	<h1>Cortex RPG Dice Roller</h1>
	<p>Version 0.1 - by Don Bisdorf (Mastodon: @dice.camp@dbisdorf, Twitter: @dbisdorf)</p>
	<h2>Getting the band together</h2>
	<p>The dice roller will automatically create a new room for you. The address bar of your browser will show the location of this room. To invite your players to join your room, send them that address.</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>Add dice to your pool using the Add buttons. Roll them with the Roll button.</p>
	<p>Select dice by clicking their checboxes. Then, using the buttons in the Selected group, you can mark your dice as total or effect dice, remove them, or step them up or down. Remember that according to Cortex rules, you can't use 1s as total or effect dice.</p>
	<p>The Mark Best buttons will automatically pick the best total or effect dice from the dice that haven't already been marked. The None button in the Mark Best group will unmark all dice.</p>
	</p>Once you've marked your total and effect dice, you can click Keep to copy them to the Past Rolls area. You can also click the All:Remove button to throw away all the dice and start over.</p>
	<p>Add sticky notes by typing something into the box at the bottom of the Sticky Notes area and clicking Post Note. Clicking the Remove button next to a note will delete the note and copy its text back into the typing area, so you can edit and re-post if you wish.</p>
	<p>The checkboxes in the Options area allow you to control how the dice appear ono the page. These options only control your view of the dice, not the views your friends are seeing.</p>
	<h2>Source code</h2>
	<p>For the brave and curious, the source code is in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/dbisdorf/cortex-roller">here.</a></p>
	<p>Please note that the code is likely terrible. I'm probably using the wrong frameworks, the wrong tools, the wrong coding conventions, and so on. But it works, and that's good enough for me.</p>
	<p>I'm not accepting pull requests just yet. This is a personal hobby project, and I'd rather not have to deal with managing a multi-coder work flow just yet. Once the system is more mature, I may be ready to let other swimmers in the pool.</p>
